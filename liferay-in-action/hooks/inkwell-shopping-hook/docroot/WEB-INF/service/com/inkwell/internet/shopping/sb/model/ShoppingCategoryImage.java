/**
 * The model interface for the ShoppingCategoryImage service. Represents a row in the &quot;Inkwell_ShoppingCategoryImage&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.inkwell.internet.shopping.sb.model.impl.ShoppingCategoryImageImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a shopping category image model instance should use the {@link ShoppingCategoryImage} interface instead.
